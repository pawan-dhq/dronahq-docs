# Configure Custom domain & Subdomain

DronaHQ provides you with an option of configuring a `custom domain` or `subdomain` in your `DronaHQ cloud edition` by navigating to `Account Settings -> Domain & Branding` post which your end users will be able to login to the `end-user portal` on the URL which is set up. 

:::info Please Note

Custom domain is only available on [Business plan](https://www.dronahq.com/pricing) of `DronaHQ cloud edition` whereas subdomain can be set up in all plans.
###
Also since the self-hosted instance is deployed at your own end, it doesn't require any specific plans and the process to set up a custom domain on `DronaHQ self-hosted instance` is specific in the self-hosted documentation.

:::

:::caution Please Note

You you need to have admin or owner level privileges to access or modify these configurations.

## Setting up Subdomain
For `DronaHQ cloud edition`, you can simply type the subdomain of your choice which will be checked for its uniqueness and once its unique, you can go ahead and save the configurations. Your `end-user portal` will be accessible on your_subdomain.dronahq.io

## Pre-requisites for Custom Domain
Before you get started, make sure you: 

- Have `admin/owner` level access to your DronaHQ account
- Own the domain name you want to connect to your site or buy a domain from a DNS provider of your choice 
- Have access to update the DNS records with your domain registrar or DNS provider
- Reset your DNS settings if you have previously linked your domain elsewhere to eliminate troubleshooting at the later stage

:::info Please Note

DronaHQ does not have any top-level domain (TLD) restrictions as long as the domain is visible in public DNS, you can connect the domain to domain nameservers (NS records), and you can create A and CNAME records.

:::

:::danger Please Note

DNS changes may take up to 48 hours for the DNS cache to expire, although this typically occurs within a few hours.

## Setting up Custom domain

You need to follow the following steps to set up yoour custom domain:
- Navigate  to `Account Settings -> Domain & Branding`
- Click on `Set up custom domain`
- `Step1`: Enter your root domain (e.g: yourdomain.com), this will add both the root domain (e.g., yourdomain.com) and the www subdomain (e.g: www.yourdomain.com) at our end
- `Step 2`: You need to validate SSL certificate by creating a CNAME record with the host as the  `name` field and value as the `value` field. 
- Once the SSL is issued and verified you can move to the next step of domain verification
- `Step 3`: You need to verify the domain by creating a CNAME record with host as @ and value as the field `generated domain name`
- Incase you want to set up a subdomain, you will have to create a CNAME record with host as `your subdomain` and value as the field `generated domain name`
- Every DNS provider has their own process for updating DNS records. We recommend that you read the help documentation of your DNS provider, and contact their support for help
- `Step 4`: You will be able to see the status of your custom domain here. There are 3 statuses namely: `pending` `in progress` and `deployed`

:::info Domains with special characters

For domains with special characters (e.g., ä, ê, ó) in Punycode format. You can use a tool like Verisign to convert your domain to Punycode, though keep in mind that it might not always work.

:::

:::danger Domains without SSL

DronaHQ doesn't support non SSL domains to be linked while setting up custom domain as it can be a potential security threat.

:::

## Verifying the custom domain
- Navigate to `Account Settings -> Domain & Branding` and you would be able to spot the different statuses of your custom domain
- Alternatively you can visit your custom domain that you linked and check if you are able to see the login screen of `end-user portal`.
- DNS changes can take up to 48 hours for the DNS cache to expire, although this typically occurs within a few hours. If your site verification doesn’t work right away, you can come back later to check the status again. 
- If everything is live and you are still experiencing issues on domain verification after 2 days, contact our support from inside the `DronaHQ creator portal`.
