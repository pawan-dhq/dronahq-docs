# Configure SMTP for system emails

There are a few system generated emails that DronaHQ sends, like user invite, forgot password. By default in the cloud edition DronaHQ sends using their own email servers. But you can customize the email server from where these emails can be sent. DronaHQ provides an SMTP configuration using which you can configure your own SMTP server or the SMTP servers of any of the popular cloud services like Google, Amazon SNS, Sendgrid and others. Navigate to `Account Settings -> Integrations -> Email configuration` to set this up. 

:::info Defaults

For the DronaHQ cloud edition the emails will by default be sent from DronaHQ email servers if this configuration is not set. If you are using the self-hosted version of DronaHQ - it is mandatory to set up and configure your own SMTP servers.
