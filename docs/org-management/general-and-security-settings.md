## Customizing end user portal homescreen

DronaHQ offers a way in which the end-user portal in some cases can be switched to a specific app. You can select the app from a list and this will enable your end-users to directly land on that particular app. The default DronaHQ home screen where you see the catalog of apps will be completely skipped. 

:::caution Please Note

All the DronaHQ features which have an effect on the homescreen of the `end-user portal` like app catalogs etc. will not be functional when you enable this feature.

## General account settings

Since the end-users would be from the specific organization its important that DronaHQ provides a way in which you can customize the privacy policy, support email and support URLs to your own which will be seen at different sections in the product.
