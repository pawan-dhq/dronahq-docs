# User details and analytics

DronaHQ provides some user details and analytics on the apps the particular user has accessed and the mobile devices which are active with the user to login to the DronaHQ `end-user portal`. 

You can navigate to `Manage USers -> Select the user -> User details` to see the user details and analytics.

:::info Please Note

The device details are only limited to mobile apps and do not cover browser access to the DronaHQ `end-user portal`. Similarly the total time spent is only tracked on the mobile apps. You can anytime revoke access to a particular device and the user will be logged out automatically on that device. This is useful when a user loses a device and wants to revoke anyone access on that device if the data is sensitive.
