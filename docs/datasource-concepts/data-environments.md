# Data Environments

DronaHQ provides the ability to configure multiple data environments for your connector, which can be beneficial to separate workspaces for different teams and enforce access management.

DronaHQ comes pre-configured with three data environments: Production, Staging, and Development, where Production is the default environment. These environments cannot be removed or modified.

## Create a new environment

You can create and manage data environments from `Manage Environments`. To create a new environment click on `+ Add Environment` and give a unique name and select the `Sheet Environment` where your data would be mapped for the newly created environment.

You can also edit or delete the environment by clicking on more options indicated by the three dots (…)

## Configure environment credentials

You can configure multiple environments for your data sources (e.g., database or API) by adding environment-specific credentials. Click on more options indicated by the three dots (…) against your data source and select `Manage Environment` option. Also, add the appropriate credentials for the environment you want to setup.
