MySQL is a powerful open-source relational database management system known for its speed, reliability, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for various applications and data-driven projects. 

## Configuring Connector

### Prerequisites

1. Authentication Credentials: Obtain the required credentials to connect to your MySQL instance. Choose from the following options:
   - MySQL database username and password.
   - AWS IAM authentication (for AWS-hosted MySQL databases).

2. Connection Details:
   - Hostname of the MySQL database.
   - Port number for database access.
   - Database name within the MySQL host.

3. Firewall Rules:
   - Set up firewall settings to allow DronaHQ (IP whitelist) access to your MySQL host.

Ensuring these prerequisites are in place will ensure a seamless integration of MySQL with DronaHQ, facilitating effective data management and utilization.

### Connector Setup in DronaHQ

Configure your database category by providing the details below. Choose between `User and Password` or `AWS IAM` Authentication. Validate the connection using `Test connection` and `Save` settings for a secure and efficient database setup.

:::tip

DronaHQ can Auto fill crucial connection values like host, name, password, and more from the connector's [connection string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) or from a AWS IAM credentials using [AWS Import](/datasource-concepts/aws_import).

## Adding Database Queries

Once the connector is configured, access it in your Connector Library. Click `Add query` after connection setup. Create queries, run them, and view responses.

:::tip
Use double curly brackets for dynamic variables. Test with sample values before saving. Link dynamic variables to controls/actions for runtime use.

Saved queries appear under your connector in Connector Library.



## Supported Query Operations

| Operations           | Description                                     |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Raw SQL Query        | Various `select, insert, delete, update`, join operations. |
| Stored Procedure Call| Call stored procedures e.g., `CALL getUserInfo;` |

## Using MySQL Connector

### Data Bind using Data Query

#### Read/Display Data Query for MySQL:

Start by constructing an SQL query to extract data from your MySQL database. For instance, let's consider an example where you want to retrieve data from the `Authors` table based on specific initials. The SQL query is:

Query used:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE initials = "{{SearchInitials}}";
```

Query explanation:

This SQL query retrieves all rows and columns from the `Authors` table where the initials match the value provided through the dynamic variable `{{SearchInitials}}`.

  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Get data query with dynamic variable.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Integrate the fetched data into your application's interface.

 a. Access the Controls section and introduce the Table grid control.

 b. Navigate to `Data Bind Options -> Quick Select -> Database Queries`.

 c. Opt for the MySQL connector and choose the query that aligns with your data presentation goals.

By following these steps, you can seamlessly retrieve and display data from the `Authors` table based on specific initials using the MySQL Connector, enhancing your application's functionality and user experience.
