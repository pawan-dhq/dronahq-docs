# DronaHQ Query Language

DQL or DronaHQ Query Language serves as an efficient query and transformation tool for JSON data, drawing inspiration from the 'location path' concepts found in XPath 3.1. This connection enables the formulation of complex queries through a condensed and user-friendly notation. The language includes a comprehensive assortment of pre-established operators and functions that facilitate the manipulation and amalgamation of the extracted information. Furthermore, the results of these queries can be molded into any desired JSON output arrangement, utilizing well-known JSON object and array constructs. Along with the capability to formulate user-specific functions, this allows for the crafting of advanced expressions designed to handle any conceivable JSON query or transformation challenge.

You can write DQL expressions in the following categories:
- [Getting basic values](/reference/dronahq-query-language/getting-basic-values/)
- [Selecting conditional data](/reference/dronahq-query-language/selecting-conditional-data)
- [Returning structured data](/reference/dronahq-query-language/returning-structured-data)
- [Manipulating data](/reference/dronahq-query-language/manipulating-data)
- [DQL functions](/reference/dronahq-query-language/dql-function-reference)
