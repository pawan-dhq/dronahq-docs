## Use Case Scenario

Let's consider a task management app where users can create and manage their to-do lists. Traditionally, without the Dynamic Repeating List of a Control, users would have to create a fixed set of cards or components show the list of tasks. This limitation may not cater to users with varying numbers of tasks on their list or those who may add new tasks over time.

By leveraging the List Repeat Control, the app developers can implement a dynamic list of tasks. Users can give a list of tasks as needed, and the app will automatically replicate the task cards of components created in control designer for each new entry. This dynamic repeating list of a control ensures that users can manage an ever-changing number of tasks with ease.

**For example**:

Initially, the user creates a to-do list with three tasks.
If the user wants to add more tasks, they can simply create and different logic and click an `Add Task` button, and a new task inputted will be visible in list repeat section will be dynamically appended to the list.
If the user wants to remove a task, they can create a different logic and click a `Delete` button and load that data again to the list repeat control and it will remove it from the list.
As a result, users can efficiently manage their to-do lists, and the app provides a user-friendly and customizable experience for managing tasks of varying quantities.
It also gives users the ability show large data with pagination and using search to filter out data, as they can use download button to download loaded data in `.csv` format.

## Conclusion

DronaHQ's List Repeat Control empowers users to create dynamic repeating lists of  a control within their applications, providing flexibility and efficiency in data management. This feature enhances user experience, simplifies data entry, and ensures real-time updates for better usability. By incorporating the Dynamic Repeating List of a Control, app developers can create versatile and user-centric solutions for managing various types of data lists, benefiting a wide range of industries and use cases.
