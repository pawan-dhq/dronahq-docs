Firestore is a highly durable database that can scale automatically to handle your applicationâ€™s load.

## Prerequisite 

1. Firebase Configuration Details:
   To connect with Firestore, gather the necessary configuration details from the Firebase console using these steps:
   - Access your Project settings.
   - Navigate to the Service accounts tab.
   - Click on the Firebase Admin SDK icon to generate a new private key.
   - Download the resulting JSON file and extract the Private key. This key is crucial for configuring the Firestore Connector.

    </figure>

2. Optionally, Google Cloud Platform Account Key:
   If you prefer, you can create an account key through your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console:
   - Choose a project in your GCP console.
   - Select `Create Service Account` and assign the `Firebase Admin` role.
   - Opt for a JSON Key type and download the resulting file. Ensure accessibility of this file for the connector's configuration.

## Adding Queries for Firestore

Once you've successfully configured the Firestore connector, you can efficiently manage data-related operations, including the `Update Document` action. Follow these steps to create and execute queries:

1. Define Query Name: Provide a unique name for your data management query. This name will serve as an identifier in your Connector Library for easy access and management.

2. Select Action - Update Document: Within the Firestore connector options, choose the `Update Document` action. This action enables you to modify existing data entries within a specific document in your Firestore database.

3. Choose Collection: After selecting the `Update Document` action, you'll have the option to choose the Firestore collection containing the document you want to update.

4. Set Additional Parameters: Depending on your specific requirements, utilize optional parameters to refine the `Update Document` action. Customize the query by implementing filters, sorting criteria, or other pertinent options.


| Parameter        | Description                                                                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Order By         | Specify the field for sorting the results in ascending or descending order.                                 |
| Order Direction  | Define the sorting direction, either ascending or descending.                                               |
| Where            | Filter documents based on specified conditions.                                                             |
| Limit            | Limit the number of documents returned in the query results.                                                |
| Start At         | Start the query results at a specific document.                                                            |
| End At           | End the query results at a specific document.                                                              |
| Document ID      | Target a specific document by its unique identifier.                                                       |
| Value            | Provide a specific value for query comparisons.                                                             |
| Parent Document ID | Reference the parent document ID for subcollection queries.                                                |

This table outlines the parameters you can utilize for performing queries and operations on your Firestore database, including ordering, filtering, limiting, and targeting specific documents.

5. Test and Execute: Before finalizing the query, perform a test run to verify its functionality. Confirm that the document's data is correctly updated within your Firestore database.
