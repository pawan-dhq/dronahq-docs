Firebase is a highly durable database that can scale automatically to handle your applicationâ€™s load.

## Prerequisite


1. Firebase Configuration Details:
   Obtain the necessary configuration details from the Firebase console. Navigate to your Project settings and select the Service accounts tab. Click on the Firebase Admin SDK icon, and generate a new private key. This action will result in the download of a JSON file. Extract the Private key from the downloaded JSON file, as you will need it for configuring the Firebase Connector.

2. Optionally, Google Cloud Platform Account Key:
   If preferred, you can create an account key from your Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console. Follow these steps:
   1. Select a project in your GCP console.
   2. Click on "Create Service Account" and assign the role of "Firebase Admin."
   3. Opt for a JSON Key type and proceed to download the generated file. Ensure to keep this file accessible, as it will be required for configuring the connector.

## Adding Data Management Queries for Firebase Realtime Database

After successfully configuring the Firebase Realtime Database connector, you can adeptly manage data-related operations. Focus on adding queries that involve the "Append data to the list" action:

1. Define Query Name: Assign a distinctive name to your data management query. This name will serve as an identifier within your Connector Library, simplifying access and management.

2. Select Action - Append data to the list: Navigate to the Firebase Realtime Database connector options and choose the `Append data to the list` action. This action empowers you to seamlessly add new data entries to an existing list in your Firebase Realtime Database.

3. Configure Data Input: Define the data you want to append to the list. Input the necessary values, ensuring they align with the structure of the list you intend to update.



| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Database Ref          | Reference a specific path within the Firebase Realtime Database for data retrieval or manipulation.              |
| Ordering              | Define the order in which data is retrieved or displayed (e.g., ascending or descending).                        |
| Value                 | Specify the data value to be appended or updated within the Firebase Realtime Database.                          |



4. Test and Execute: Prior to finalizing, conduct a test run to verify the query's functionality. Ensure that the appended data appears correctly within the designated list in your Firebase Realtime Database.

:::tip
Use double curly brackets for dynamic variables. Test with sample values before saving. Link dynamic variables to controls/actions and more for runtime use.

Saved queries appear under your connector in Connector Library.

#### Supported Actions

## Using Firebase Realtime Database Connector

### Appending Data to a List

To append data to a list within the Firebase Realtime Database using the Firebase Realtime Database Connector, follow these steps:

1. Access Data Bind Section or Control Action:
   - Navigate to the data bind section of the control.

2. Select Firebase Realtime Database Connector from `Data Bind Options -> Quick Select -> Data Queries`:
   - Choose Firebase Realtime Database Connector from the available options.
   - Select the "Append data to a list" action to add new data to an existing list.
   - Click on "Continue" to proceed.

 </figure>

3. Configure Data Input:
   - Specify the Database Ref, which is the reference to the existing list where you want to append data.
   - Provide the values to append as dynamic values. This can include any type of data, arrays, or objects.

4. Integrate with Controls and Actions:
   - Integrate this query into your workflow by adding controls like a TextInput field for user input.
   - Create an action flow that triggers the Connector action to append data.
   - Configure the connector to pass the value from the TextInput control as input.
