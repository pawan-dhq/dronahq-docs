ClickHouse is a fast open source OLAP DBMS that can come to use for such applications. So letâ€™s see how we can integrate ClickhouseDB in DronaHQ.

Of course, here's the prerequisite information for connecting to ClickHouse in the requested format:

## Prerequisite 

1. Authentication Requirements: Before establishing a connection with your ClickHouse instance, ensure you have the necessary authentication credentials, which include:
   - ClickHouse database URL.
   - Username for accessing the ClickHouse database.
   - Password associated with the provided username for authentication.

2. Connection Details:
   - Obtain the ClickHouse database URL, including the protocol (e.g., `https`) and port number.
   - Enter the username required to access the ClickHouse database.
   - Provide the password associated with the specified username.

3. Firewall and Network Configuration:
   - Configure your firewall to allow communication between your application and the ClickHouse server.

## Configuring Connector in DronaHQ

Configure your database category using the provided details.Validate connection with `Test connection` and `Save` settings for secure database setup.


#### General 

| Field                | Description                             |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| ClickHouse database URL | Please enter clickhouse db url e.g.`https://play-api.clickhouse.com:8443` |
| Username             | Enter the Username                      |
| Password             | Enter the Password                      |
| Database | Database name will help in poulating schema in query editor |

#### Admin

| Advanced Option   | Description    |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Connection Options | The `key` and `value` connection options in database configuration refer to specific settings (keys) and their corresponding values that dictate how the application connects to the database |
| Use Dynamic Database Host                | Dynamically determine the host for the database connection.                               |
| Use Dynamic Database Name                | Set the database name dynamically, allowing easy switching between databases.              |
| <VersionedLink to = "../../datasource-concepts/dynamic_credentials"> Use Dynamic Database Credentials        </VersionedLink> | Enable dynamic database credentials for secure and convenient management.                  |
| <VersionedLink to = "../../datasource-concepts/ssl_configurations"> Connect using SSL  </VersionedLink> | Securely access the database using an encrypted SSL connection, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality. |
| <VersionedLink to = "../../datasource-concepts/whitelisting_dronahq_ip"> Whitelist IP                 </VersionedLink>            | Enhance security by restricting database access to specific whitelisted IP addresses.     |


## Adding Database Queries
After configuring the connector, access it in your Connector Library. 
To add queries, click `Add query` once the connection is ready. Create simple or complex queries, view tables and fields. Input Query name, run the query, and see results in Response.

</figure>

:::tip
Use double curly brackets for dynamic variables. Test with sample values before saving. Link dynamic variables to controls/actions and more for runtime use. 
:::

Saved queries appear under your connector in Connector Library.

## Supported Query Operations

| Operations   | Description    |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Raw SQL Query | Various `select, insert, delete, update, join` operations which are supported by PostgresSQL query. e.g. - `select * from UserInfo;` |
| Stored Procedure Call | You can call store procedure similar to that we call from workbench. e.g. - `CALL getUserInfo;` |



## Using ClickHouse Connector

### Data Bind using Data Query

#### Read/Display Data Query for ClickHouse Connector:

Start by constructing an SQL query to extract data from your ClickHouse database using the ClickHouse Connector. Consider a scenario where you want to retrieve all data from a specified database. The SQL query is:

Query used:

```sql
SELECT * FROM {{database}};
```

Query explanation:

This SQL query retrieves all rows and columns from the specified database within the ClickHouse database.

  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Query example for retrieving data from ClickHouse database using ClickHouse Connector.</i></figcaption>
</figure>

Integrate the fetched data into your application's interface.

 a. Access the Controls section and introduce the Table grid control.

 b. Navigate to `Data Bind Options -> Quick Select -> Database Queries`.

 c. Opt for the ClickHouse connector and choose the query that aligns with your data presentation goals.
