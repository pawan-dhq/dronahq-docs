MongoDB revolutionizes data management with its innovative NoSQL approach, offering a flexible and scalable solution for modern application development.


## Prerequisite

1. Authentication Requirements: To establish a connection with your MongoDB instance, you will require specific authentication credentials. You have the choice of either of the following two credential options:
   - MongoDB database username and password.
   - Alternative authentication methods (excluding AWS IAM authentication).

2. Connection Details:
   - Hostname of the MongoDB database.
   - Port number for database communication.
   - The designated database name within the MongoDB host.

3. Firewall Rules:
   - Set up your firewall settings to permit DronaHQ's IP whitelist for access to your MongoDB host.

Having these essential prerequisites in place will ensure a seamless integration of MongoDB with DronaHQ, facilitating efficient data management and utilization without the need for AWS credentials.


## Configuring Connector in DronaHQ

Configure your database category using the provided details.Validate connection with `Test connection` and `Save` settings for secure database setup.

:::tip
DronaHQ can Auto fill crucial connection values like host, name, password, and more from the connector's [connection string](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/connection-string/).

## Adding Database Queries

After configuring the connector, access it in your Connector Library. Click `Add query` following the connection setup. Here's how you can create and manage queries for your MongoDB database:

1. Name your Query: Provide a unique name for your query, which will be used for easy access.

2. Select a Collection: Specify the MongoDB collection on which you want to perform the action. This helps direct the query to the desired data set.

2. Choose an Action: MongoDB supports various actions, each with specific parameters. Select the appropriate action from the list provided. For example, if you select `Find` as the action, the available parameters will include Filter, Projection, Sort, Limit, and Skip. If you choose `InsertOne,` the parameters will change to Insert as Key: Value string.

3. Set Parameters: Depending on the chosen action, input the necessary parameters. For instance, if you're performing a `Find` action, specify the filter conditions and other relevant details. If it's an `InsertOne` action, provide the data you want to insert.

| Parameter   | Description                                                                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Filter      | Criteria to match documents. Specify conditions to filter and retrieve specific data from the collection. |
| Projection  | Fields to include/exclude from results. Define which fields should be included or excluded in the query results. |
| Sort        | Sorting order for results. Specify how the query results should be sorted based on one or more fields. |
| Skip        | Number of documents to skip. Set the offset for the query results, skipping a certain number of documents. |
| Limit       | Maximum number of documents to retrieve. Set a limit on the number of documents returned by the query. |
| Update      | Modifications to apply. Define the changes you want to make to the selected documents in the collection. |
| Document    | Data to be inserted. Provide the document or data that you want to insert into the collection. |
| Stages      | Array of stages for aggregation pipeline. Define a series of processing stages to transform and analyze data in the collection. |
| Field       | Field for which distinct values are sought. Specify the field from which you want to find distinct values. |
| Aggregation | Stages for aggregation pipeline. Define various stages such as grouping, filtering, and transformation to perform data aggregation. |


4. Run the Query: Once you've configured the action and parameters, you can execute the query by clicking `Test Query` The response will be displayed based on the provided parameters, allowing you to review the retrieved data or the outcome of the query.
