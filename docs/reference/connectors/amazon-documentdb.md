Amazon Document DB is a document-based database. Amazon DocumentDB is a scalable, highly durable, and fully managed database service for operating mission-critical MongoDB workloads. You can use the connector to carry out various operations including querying and inserting and updating details.

## Prerequisite

1. Authentication Credentials: You will need specific authentication credentials to establish a connection with your Amazon DocumentDB instance. 

2. Connection Details:
   - Endpoint of your Amazon DocumentDB instance.
   - Port number for database communication.
   - The designated database name within the Amazon DocumentDB instance.

3. Network Configuration:
   - Configure your network settings to allow access from the necessary sources to your Amazon DocumentDB host.

4. AWS Credentials: If your use case requires AWS services in conjunction with the Amazon DocumentDB connector, ensure you have valid AWS credentials with appropriate permissions.

## Configuring Connector in DronaHQ

Configure your database category using the provided details.Validate connection with `Test connection` and `Save` settings for secure database setup.

:::tip
DronaHQ can Auto fill crucial connection values like host, name, password, and more from the connector's [connection string](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/endpoints-connecting.html#endpoints-connecting-mongodb).

## Adding Database Queries 

Once you have successfully configured the Amazon DocumentDB connector, you can manage your database queries through the Connector Library. Follow these steps to create and manage queries for your Amazon DocumentDB:

1. Name your Query: Assign a unique name to your query for easy identification and access.

2. Select a Collection: Choose the specific collection within your Amazon DocumentDB instance on which you intend to execute the query. This ensures that your query is targeted to the correct dataset.

3. Choose an Action: Amazon DocumentDB supports a range of actions, each with distinct parameters. Select the appropriate action from the available options. For instance, if you opt for the `Find` action, you'll have parameters such as Filter, Projection, Sort, Limit, and Skip at your disposal. If you go with `InsertOne,` the parameters will transform into a Key: Value string for insertion.

4. Set Parameters: Based on the chosen action, provide the required parameters. For example, if you're executing a `Find` action, define the filter criteria and other pertinent details. In the case of an `InsertOne` action, input the data you wish to insert.


| Parameter   | Description                                                                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Filter      | Criteria to match documents. Specify conditions to filter and retrieve specific data from the collection. |
| Projection  | Fields to include/exclude from results. Define which fields should be included or excluded in the query results. |
| Sort        | Sorting order for results. Specify how the query results should be sorted based on one or more fields. |
| Skip        | Number of documents to skip. Set the offset for the query results, skipping a certain number of documents. |
| Limit       | Maximum number of documents to retrieve. Set a limit on the number of documents returned by the query. |
| Update      | Modifications to apply. Define the changes you want to make to the selected documents in the collection. |
| Document    | Data to be inserted. Provide the document or data that you want to insert into the collection. |
| Stages      | Array of stages for aggregation pipeline. Define a series of processing stages to transform and analyze data in the collection. |
| Field       | Field for which distinct values are sought. Specify the field from which you want to find distinct values. |
| Aggregation | Stages for aggregation pipeline. Define various stages such as grouping, filtering, and transformation to perform data aggregation. |

5. Run the Query: Once you've configured the action and parameters, you can execute the query by clicking `Test Query` The response will be displayed based on the provided parameters, allowing you to review the retrieved data or the outcome of the query.
