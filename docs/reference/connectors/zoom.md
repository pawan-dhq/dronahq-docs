Zoom Connector allows you to seamlessly interact with Zoom's features. You can list scheduled or recorded meetings and create new meetings using the connector's actions.

## Configuring API Connector in DronaHQ

Add a `Account name`. Then click `Save`, it will open a pop-up window askinging you to sign-in into your Zoom account. Continue with the steps and give access to DronaHQ to connect with your Zoom ID and its information.

After successfully configuring and saving the connector settings, you can easily access your newly connected account by navigating to the `connected accounts` list. You can find this option from the `Connector -> Manage Account` section. This centralized location allows you to conveniently monitor and manage your connected accounts.
