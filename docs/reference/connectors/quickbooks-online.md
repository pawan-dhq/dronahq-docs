QuickBooks Online is a cloud-based accounting software that helps businesses manage financial tasks like invoicing, expense tracking, and tax preparation. The QuickBooks Online connector enables seamless integration for data exchange and automation between the platform and other applications.

## Configuring API Connector in DronaHQ

Add a `Account name`. Then click `Save`, it will open a pop-up window askinging you to sign-in into your QuickBooks Online account. Continue with the steps and give access to DronaHQ to connect with your QuickBooks Online ID and its information.

After successfully configuring and saving the connector settings, you can easily access your newly connected account by navigating to the `connected accounts` list. You can find this option from the `Connector -> Manage Account` section. This centralized location allows you to conveniently monitor and manage your connected accounts.
