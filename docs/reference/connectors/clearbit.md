Clearbit is a data enrichment platform that provides accurate and up-to-date information about individuals and companies

## Prerequisite 

1. Clearbit API Key: Obtain an API key from Clearbit by signing up for an account and creating a new API key. This key is required to authenticate your requests when using the Clearbit Connector.

2. Environment Setup: Ensure you have a development environment capable of making HTTP requests to external APIs. This could involve using programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or any language that supports HTTP requests.

## Configuring API Connector in DronaHQ

Add a `Account name`. Then add the `API key` for the connector account. Once all details are added, click `Save`. Your connector configuration is now done.
