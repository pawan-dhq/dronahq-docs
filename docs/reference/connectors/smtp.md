## Using SMTP Connector

### Send mail

Configure its components, such as the `sender's email, receiver's email, subject`, and more, directly from the action flow.

1. Navigate to the action flow where you wish to set up the SMTP action, specifically the server-side action.

2. Choose the SMTP action to send mail.

4. In the subsequent step, you'll encounter various predefined input fields, allowing you to define key details for your email transmission.

   - Sender and Receiver: Specify the email addresses of the sender and receiver. You can also include BCC (Blind Carbon Copy) and CC (Carbon Copy) emails as needed.

   - Reply To: Designate the email address where replies will be directed when the recipient responds to the email.

   - Subject: Provide a subject line for system-generated emails that are intended to be sent.

   - Content Type: Choose between two content types:

     - HTML: This option enables you to incorporate formatted text, URLs, images, and styling components into the email content using HTML tags.

     - Text: This option is suitable for plain text without any additional styling or formatting.

   - Message Body: Enter the body content for the email, including the main message you wish to convey.

   - Attachments: Include images or files to be sent alongside the email. You can add files using File Upload or Text Input controls and bind their keywords to the attachments' input section. Multiple URLs and files can also be added.
