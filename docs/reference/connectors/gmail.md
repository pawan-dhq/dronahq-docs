The Gmail Connector facilitates seamless integration with your Gmail account, enabling actions like sending emails, retrieving messages, and managing labels, streamlining your communication tasks.

## Configuring API Connector in DronaHQ

Add a `Account name`. Then click `Save`, it will open a pop-up window askinging you to sign-in into your Google account. Continue with the steps and give access to DronaHQ to connect with your Google ID and its information.

After successfully configuring and saving the connector settings, you can easily access your newly connected account by navigating to the `connected accounts` list. You can find this option from the `Connector -> Manage Account` section. This centralized location allows you to conveniently monitor and manage your connected accounts.
