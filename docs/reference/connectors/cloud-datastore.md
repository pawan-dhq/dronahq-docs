Cloud Datastore is a highly durable database that can scale automatically to handle your applicationâ€™s load.

## Prerequisite

1. Authentication Requirements: Before establishing a connection with Cloud Datastore, ensure you have the necessary authentication credentials, including:
   - Google Cloud Project ID.
   - Service Account Key File: Create a Service Account on the Google Cloud Console and generate a JSON key file. This key file contains the credentials required for authentication.

2. Enable Cloud Datastore API: In the Google Cloud Console, make sure that the Cloud Datastore API is enabled for your project. This API allows your application to interact with Cloud Datastore.

3. Service Account Access: Grant the Service Account associated with your application the necessary permissions to access Cloud Datastore. Assign the appropriate roles, such as `Cloud Datastore User` or `Cloud Datastore Viewer,` to the Service Account.

4. Download and Secure Key: Download the JSON key file generated for the Service Account. Safeguard this key file as it contains essential credentials for authenticating your application's access to Cloud Datastore.

## Adding Queries

To retrieve an entity from Google Cloud Datastore using the `Get Entity by Key` action, follow these steps:

1. Define Query Name: Assign a meaningful query name that represents the specific data retrieval operation you are performing. This name will be used as an identifier in your Connector Library.

2. Select Action - Get Entity by Key: In the Google Cloud Datastore connector options, choose the `Get Entity by Key` action. This action allows you to fetch a single entity from your Google Cloud Datastore based on a provided key.

3. Configure Data Input:
   - Specify the Entity Kind: Select the kind of entity you want to retrieve from Google Cloud Datastore.
   - Provide the Entity Key: Enter the key associated with the entity you wish to retrieve.

   | Data Input    | Description                                                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Namespace    | Specifies the namespace under which the entity is stored. Namespace is used to logically partition data. |
| Key          | Unique identifier for the entity within the specified namespace and kind. |
| Kind         | Represents the category or type of the entity. It helps organize and group related entities together. |
| Query        | Defines the conditions and criteria for retrieving specific entities from the Cloud Datastore. |
| Data         | Displayed data fields of the retrieved entity, including properties and their corresponding values. |


4. Execute and View Response:
   - Run the configured query to retrieve the entity by its key.
   - The response will contain the data associated with the specified entity key.

Saved queries appear under your connector in Connector Library.


#### Supported Actions

| Action                  | Description                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Get Entity by Key       | Retrieve an entity from Cloud Datastore based on a specified key.                                          |
| Save Entity by Key      | Add or update an entity in Cloud Datastore using a specified key.                                          |
| Delete Entity by Key    | Remove an entity from Cloud Datastore using a specified key.                                              |

       <figcaption align = "center"><i>Cloud Datastore Get Entity by Key</i></figcaption>
 </figure>

3. Configure Entity Key:
   - Specify the Key of the entity you want to retrieve. The Key uniquely identifies the entity within Cloud Datastore.

4. Integrate with Controls and Actions:
   - Integrate this query into your application by adding controls such as a TextInput field for entering the entity key.
   - Create an action flow that triggers the Cloud Datastore Connector action to retrieve the entity.
   - Configure the connector to pass the entity key from the TextInput control as input.
