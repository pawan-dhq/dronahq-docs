ProxyCrawl Connector enables easy integration with ProxyCrawl's web scraping and data extraction services, providing efficient ways to fetch data from websites while bypassing CAPTCHAs and other blocks. 

## Prerequisite 

1. Proxy Crawl Token key: Obtain an Token key from Proxy Crawl by signing up for an account and creating a new Token key. This key is required to authenticate your requests when using the Proxy Crawl Connector.

2. Environment Setup: Ensure you have a development environment capable of making HTTP requests to external APIs. This could involve using programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or any language that supports HTTP requests.

## Configuring API Connector in DronaHQ

Add a `Account name`. Then add the `Token` for the connector account. Once all details are added, click `Save`. Your connector configuration is now done.

After successfully configuring and saving the connector settings, you can easily access your newly connected account by navigating to the `connected accounts` list. You can find this option from the `Connector -> Manage Account` section. This centralized location allows you to conveniently monitor and manage your connected accounts.
