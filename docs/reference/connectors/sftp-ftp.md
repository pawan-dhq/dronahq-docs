SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) are connectors provided by DronaHQ. SFTP ensures secure file transfer using encryption, while FTP is a standard protocol for transferring files between a client and a server on a network.

## Prerequisite

1. Server Authentication: To use the SFTP or FTP connector provided by DronaHQ, you need valid authentication credentials. Choose either of the following options:
   - Username and password for FTP authentication.
   - SSH key pair for SFTP authentication.

2. Connection Details:
   - Server Hostname or IP address for communication.
   - Port number for connecting to the server (21 for FTP, 22 for SFTP).

3. File Locations: Familiarize yourself with the server's directory structure where you'll be performing file operations.

4. Connection Mode: Understand whether the connection requires Active or Passive mode, especially for FTP connections.

|--------------------|---------------------|
| Connection Options | The `key` and `value` connection options in database configuration refer to specific settings (keys) and their corresponding values that dictate how the application connects to the database |
|SSH Keys | Ensure you have SSH keys available in your DronaHQ account for secure connections. The server you want to connect to must have the DronaHQ-generated public key/SSH Key saved in it. |
| <VersionedLink to = "../../datasource-concepts/whitelisting-dronahq-ip"> Whitelist IP                 </VersionedLink>            | Enhance security by restricting database access to specific whitelisted IP addresses.     |

## Adding List Directory Queries to SFTP and FTP Connectors

After successfully configuring the SFTP and FTP connectors, you can utilize the List Directory action to manage your file directories. Here's how you can create and handle list directory queries for these protocols:

1. Query Definition: Give your query a unique name to easily identify and manage it.

3. Action Choice: Select the List Directory action from the available options. This action retrieves a list of files and directories within the specified path.

4. Set Path: Provide the path for the directory you want to list. This could be an absolute path or a relative path from the root directory of the connected server.

5. Run the Query: Once you've configured the action and parameters, you can execute the query by clicking `Test Query` The response will be displayed based on the provided parameters, allowing you to review the retrieved data or the outcome of the query.

:::tip
Utilize double curly brackets for incorporating dynamic variables. Prior to saving, test with sample values. Associate dynamic variables with controls/actions for real-time utilization.

Your saved queries will be visible beneath your connector within the Connector Library.
