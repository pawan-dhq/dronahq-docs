OpenAI is a company that focuses on advanced AI research and development to provide crucial AI methods and benefits. The OpenAI API works virtually on any sort of functioning which requires understanding or generating natural commands, language, code, image, and more.



## Prerequisite 
1. OpenAI API Key: Obtain an API key from OpenAI by signing up for an account and creating a new API key. This key is required to authenticate your requests when using the OpenAI Connector.

2. Environment Setup: Ensure you have a development environment capable of making HTTP requests to external APIs. This could involve using programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or any language that supports HTTP requests.


## Configuring API Connector in DronaHQ

Add a `Account name`. Then add the `API key` for the connector account. Once all details are added, click `Save`. Your connector configuration is now done.

:::info 
You should have an account on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) to get the API â€“ keys. You can fetch API keys from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

After successfully configuring and saving the connector settings, you can easily access your newly connected account by navigating to the `connected accounts` list. You can find this option from the `Connector -> Manage Account` section. This centralized location allows you to conveniently monitor and manage your connected accounts.
