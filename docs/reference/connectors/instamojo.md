The Instamojo connector provides integration with the Instamojo payment gateway, enabling seamless payment processing and management of transactions. Instamojo is a popular platform that facilitates online payments, digital product selling, and donation collection. 

## Prerequisites

4. Base URL: Identify the Instamojo API base URL. This is typically the endpoint where you will make API requests. It can usually be found in the Instamojo API documentation.
`Enter base url. For Production use - www.instamojo.com and for sandbox use - test.instamojo.com`
