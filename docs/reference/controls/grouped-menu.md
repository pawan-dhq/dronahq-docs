The Grouped Menu Control is a versatile navigation component that allows the creation of a well-organized menu. It effectively groups navigation items together based on shared categories, providing an organized and seamless user experience.

The Grouped Menu control simplifies the process of creating a navigation menu by automatically organizing menu items into logical groups. Instead of designing the groups separately, you can easily assign each menu item to its corresponding group, and the control will handle the rest. This allows for a seamless and efficient creation of the menu, streamlining the user interface development.

## Utilizing the Grouped Menu Control

The Grouped Menu Control will then appear on the screen in the builder, you can then set all the above properties as per your requirements.

The Grouped Menu is mainly a navigation control and does not have any data binding. You simply specify the Page to navigate to and specify whether the screen would be validated on navigation. You need to make sure that you link the right screen based on the menu item. You would already be setting the properties for color settings on hovering the mouse over an item and color settings on selecting an item.
