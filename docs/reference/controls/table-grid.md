The Table Grid control is a type of Display control that obtains data from a Sheet, connector, or other data source and displays it in a table format. The table can be sorted, filtered, paginated, and downloaded, and includes features like row selection and insertion, server-side pagination, and custom columns.

## Binding Data Options

Table Grid control accepts array of objects to display data. There are different ways in which you can bind data to the Table Grid control.

### Static Data Option

To display static options in the Table Grid control, you can use the Bind Data option.

The Bind Data option must be specified as an array of objects. For example:

```js
  [
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Carlyn Bartle",
    "email": "Carlyn.Bartle@example.com"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Murry Rowsel",
    "email": "Murry.Rowsel@example.com"
  }
]
```

### Dynamic Data Option

You can dynamically Bind options by fetching data from `Data queries`, `Sheets` or `Custom functions` by binding the response to the Data Bind option. For example: 

Let's fetch data from a configured SQL connector."We have a predefined query, `getDetails`, that fetches data from the SQL database using the connector."  The SQL syntax for this query:

```sql
  SELECT * FROM orderdetails
```

In the Tbale Grid control, Bind Data Options, select the `Quick Select -> Connector Library -> SQL_Connector -> getDetails`

Real-time visualization of table grid control changes in the builder view, with updated data fetched from an SQL database.

## Server-Side Pagination

Server-side pagination is a technique for displaying large data sets in a web application by dividing the data into pages and only sending the current page to the browser. This can improve performance and make the data easier to manage.

Pagination is enabled in the table grid control by toggling on the `Allow Pagination` option. When pagination is enabled, you can set three properties for the table grid control: `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`, and `ROWS PER PAGE`.

`LIMIT` defines the number of records fetched for a single page. `ROWS PER PAGE` sets the number of rows visible per page. `OFFSET` is used to skip the first n rows.

For connectors that support cursor-based pagination, such as Airtable, you must select `Cursor Based Pagination` as the type and use the `OFFSET key` from the respective connector.

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| Rows per page | This allows you to set the index value of the default selected row. |
| Default offset | This allows you to set the default Offset to start pagination from. |
| Default selected row | Is the row selected by default on loading of the data. |
| Height | This allows you to set the height for the table grid control. |
| Visible | By default you can set the visible rows and columns to specify the height of the control. |

:::info
When the pagination is enabled your Filter and the Search features do not work on the columns. However, if you disable pagination you would note that the search provides you with the rows matching the search text. The Filter feature would also allow you specify the filter conditions
