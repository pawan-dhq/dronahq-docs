The Container control enables you to arrange your controls in a simple and easy-to-navigate layout. It is typically useful when you have large and complex forms that can be made easier by allowing absolute resizing in pixels within the parent Container size.

<figure>
  <Thumbnail src="/img/reference/controls/container/preview.jpeg" alt="Container" />
  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Container</i></figcaption>
</figure>


:::info
This control is only available in the Free Flow Editor which has enhanced functionality for managing controls on a grid layout.
