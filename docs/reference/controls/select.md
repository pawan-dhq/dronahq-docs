A Select control can be used when the user needs to be provided the option to select one or multiple options belonging to related groups.

  <figcaption align = "center"><i>Select</i></figcaption>
</figure>



## Binding Data Options 

The Select control accepts an array of strings for Options and a string for Selected Option. There are different ways in which you can bind data to the Select control.


### Options - Data Binding

The Options section allows you to bind data to the Select control to display the available options in the dropdown list. You can provide an array of strings to represent the options that will be shown in the dropdown. For example:

```js
[
  "Red",
  "Blue",
  "Green",
  "Yellow"
]
```

### Selected Option - Data Binding

The Selected Option section allows you to bind data to the Select control to pre-select an option in the dropdown. You can provide a single string value that matches one of the options in the Options list. For example:

```js
"Green"
```

By using the data binding options for the Select control, you can dynamically populate the dropdown options and pre-select the desired option based on the data provided. In this example, the dropdown will show the colors "Red," "Blue," "Green," and "Yellow," with "Green" being the pre-selected option.
