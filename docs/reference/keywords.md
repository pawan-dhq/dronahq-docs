# Keywords

Keywords are predefined variables in a studio that users can use in their applications. They provide important information about the logged-in user or the application's state, which is vital for building logical workflows. In the Studio, there are three different sets of keywords available, each serving different purposes and located in various locations within the studio.

- [App builder keywords](/reference/keywords.md/#app-builder-keywords)
- [Automation keywords](/reference/keywords.md/#automation-keywords)
- [BPM Flow keywords](/reference/keywords.md/#bpm-flow-keywords)

## App builder keywords
In app development, keywords play a crucial role as they are used during the app-building process and are also visible in the app's preview and final published version. Generally, two types of keywords are utilized: `Dynamically generated` and `Predefined or Static`.

Dynamically generated keywords, such as Routing Keywords and Querystring Keywords, are generated dynamically based on configuration, allowing for more flexibility and customization.

On the other hand, Predefined or static keywords are pre-initialized during the app initialisation process. These keywords values may change if modified using actions or on some system events.

Following are list of all the static keywords:

 | Keyword | Description |

 | USER EMAIL | Stores the logged-in user's email address. |
 | USERNAME | Stores the logged-in user's name. |
