### Storage database

By default, all deployments include a containerized instance of `MYSQL` and `MONGODB` along with `DronaHQ` and `NGINX` (web server). But, it is possible and highly recommended to externalize the database, to support a stateless deployment. Externalizing databases helps you make your installation more maintainable, scalable and reliable.

The minimum recommended version for the MYSQL database is version 8.0 and for MongoDB it is version 5.0.
